# drogue
Dimly-lit dungeons, deep delving dooms.

## What is this?
Drogue is a 1-dimensional roguelike. You can only go in two directions - forward (deeper into the dungeon) and backwards (fleeing to safety). You will receive hints that tell you what encounters remain in each room. If you run away while monsters are still present, they might catch up!

## Installation
Download `drogue.py`. Run it using Python 3.8 or above. Newcomers are highly encouraged to use the `-vb` flag to show more detailed information.
